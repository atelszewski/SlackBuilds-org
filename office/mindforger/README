Thinking Notebook & Markdown Editor

MindForger is human mind inspired personal knowledge management tool.
MindForger starts where editors and search engines end. It thinks as
you search, browse, read and write. Once you find a remark, MindForger
brings its associations. As you browse notes and read them it looks up
related relevant knowledge in your notebooks. If you edit a remark,
MindForger brings associations as you write. It reminds you about
existing content related to the text being written.
