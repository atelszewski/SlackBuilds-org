Podman: A tool for managing OCI containers and pods

Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and images,
volumes mounted into those containers, and pods made from groups of
containers. Podman runs containers on Linux, but can also be used on
Mac and Windows systems using a Podman-managed virtual machine. Podman
is based on libpod, a library for container lifecycle management.
The libpod library provides APIs for managing containers, pods,
container images, and volumes.

At a high level, the scope of Podman and libpod is the following:

- Support for multiple container image formats, including OCI and
  Docker images.
- Full management of those images, including pulling from various
  sources (including trust and verification), creating (built via
  Containerfile or Dockerfile or committed from a container), and
  pushing to registries and other storage backends.
- Full management of container lifecycle, including creation (both from
  an image and from an exploded root filesystem), running, checkpointing
  and restoring (via CRIU), and removal.
- Full management of container networking, using Netavark.
- Support for pods, groups of containers that share resources and are
  managed together.
- Support for running containers and pods without root or other elevated
  privileges.
- Resource isolation of containers and pods.
- Support for a Docker-compatible CLI interface, which can both run
  containers locally and on remote systems.
- No manager daemon, for improved security and lower resource
  utilization at idle.
- Support for a REST API providing both a Docker-compatible interface
  and an improved interface exposing advanced Podman functionality.
- Support for running on Windows and Mac via virtual machines run by
  podman machine.

**FIXME**

- Add HERE the minimal info about running rootless:

  - Add text explaining what is `rootless`,
  - Point at documentation: docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md
  - Provide the minimal instructions to run rootless,
    that is:
    
    ```
    $ usermod --add-subuids 100000-165535 --add-subgids 100000-165535 johndoe
    ```
- .info:

  - Update download link?
    It now points to `libpod`, but maybe it's possible to point to `podman`?

- .SlackBuild:
  
  - Take a look at https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/podman
    Anything to incorporate from it into the .SlackBuild?
    
  - Add extra documentation, at least the one from `docs/tutorials`.

- What about configuration files?

  Other distros have the `containers-common` package with these config files,
  i.e. https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/containers-common/-/blob/main/PKGBUILD
  
  Consider adding this package as well. If so, config files from this
  SlackBuild should be removed. `doints.sh` should be cleaned-up
  as well -- or maybe removed if there are no config files left.

- General:

  - check the generated packages -- what files are there?
  - check build log for possible issues.
