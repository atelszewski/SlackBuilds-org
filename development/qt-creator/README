Qt Creator is a cross-platform IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
tailored to the needs of Qt developers, but is also perfectly usable
for non-Qt C/C++ projects. Qt Creator focuses on providing features
that help new Qt users get up and running faster, and also boost the
productivity of experienced Qt developers.

Feature highlights include:
- advanced code editor,
- visual debugger,
- GUI designers.

NOTES:

1. This package conflicts with qt-creator2:
   install only one of the two.

2. Before building your application, you might want to first configure
   toolchains under: Tools -> Options -> Kits.

3. QmlDesigner will work properly only if you configure the Qt5 Kit
   properly and make it the Default Kit.

4. An old IDE configuration in user home directory
   (~/.config/QtProject*) can lead to strange behavior.

5. Some functionality of Qt Creator, like Clang Code Model or Clang
   Static Analyzer, depends on the qt-creator-llvm package. To enable
   these additional features, build and install qt-creator-llvm package
   and then build the Qt Creator package like that:

       $ USE_LLVM=yes ./qt-creator.SlackBuild

6. qbs is an optional run-time dependency (available from SBo).
