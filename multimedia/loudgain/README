loudgain is a loudness normalizer that scans music files and calculates
loudness-normalized gain and loudness peak values according to
the EBU R128 standard, and can optionally write ReplayGain-compatible
metadata.

EBU R128 is a set of recommendations regarding loudness normalisation
based on the algorithms to measure audio loudness and true-peak audio
level defined in the ITU BS.1770 standard.

Please refer to the project website for further detail.
